![Project Architecture](./GlueProject/Serverless%20Structure.PNG)

## Overview
**Serverless Watchtower** is a serverless solution designed to monitor, process, and alert on events within an AWS ecosystem. By leveraging **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon S3**, **CloudWatch**, and **Gmail**, this project provides real-time insights and notifications, ensuring seamless automation and issue tracking.

## Key Features
- **Serverless Architecture**: Fully serverless solution powered by AWS Lambda and Amazon S3.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Uses CloudWatch to monitor events and trigger appropriate actions.
- **Automated Alerts**: Sends email notifications via Gmail for critical events.
- **Event-Driven Workflows**: Automates processing of S3 bucket changes with Lambda functions.
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Built-in mechanisms to validate and process data during ingestion.

## Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Files uploaded to Amazon S3 trigger an AWS Lambda function for processing.
   - The Lambda function validates and extracts data.

2. **Event Monitoring**:
   - CloudWatch tracks events and triggers secondary Lambda functions as needed.
   - Processed data is stored in a secondary S3 bucket.

3. **Alerting and Notifications**:
   - CloudWatch monitors for specific metrics or errors.
   - Email alerts are sent via Gmail for critical events.

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: Serverless infrastructure automatically scales with demand.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go model ensures minimal costs for idle time.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Managed services reduce operational overhead.
- **Fast Notifications**: Instant alerts enable quick responses to critical issues.

## Technologies Used
- **Amazon S3**: For file storage and triggering events.
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless compute to process data and automate workflows.
- **CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging events.
- **Gmail**: For sending email alerts.
- **AWS IAM**: For secure access and role management.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with additional notification channels like **Slack** or **SMS**.
- Add advanced error handling and retry mechanisms.
- Enable detailed analytics on processed data using **Amazon Athena**.
